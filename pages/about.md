## About Fairfield Bird Club

The Fairfield (Iowa) Bird Club was active from 1933 through the mid-1950s. The club's monthly meetings consisted of informational presentations and discussions about birds. The collection contains reports, administrative records, correspondence, notes, programs, and other ephemera.
